        memories, bitter fights they are part of our friendship and I am really proud of you for the Udit you are. Never let
        yourself down. Always enjoy every small moments of your life. Thank you for being one of the best person in my life and
        making my college fabulous. I don't remember the day we met but I remember the days we enjoyed together we laughed
        together and all those chats we have together. I hope you able to reach the top of your ladder and have a peaceful and
        happy life with your family and your loved ones. Happy Birthday again!
